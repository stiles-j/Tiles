A simple little jQuery based game that emulates the behavior of the sliding
number puzzles I used to play with as a kid.  Largely done as an experiment 
because it required some interesting approaches to working with 2-dimensional
arrays to represent the data.  

To use, just download the file and launch tileGame1.html in a browser.
